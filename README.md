# MQtest

### [MQtest](https://viljamis.github.io/mqtest/) is a simple tool to help identify which media queries your device responds to.

This test isn’t about what media queries your device [can or cannot](http://www.jordanm.co.uk/palmreader) see (but it does show an 'unsupported' label if a device doesn‘t support something). Instead it shows you which dimensions your device will respond to when using 'width=device-width,initial-scale=1.'

Built by [Viljami Salminen](http://twitter.com/viljamis). Some parts of the tests adopted from [Quirksmode.org](http://www.quirksmode.org/m/tests/widthtest_vpdevice.html), [Aspect Ratio Calculator](http://andrew.hedges.name/experiments/aspect_ratio/) and [BBC’s Device Reporter](http://bbc-news-prototypes.heroku.com/reporter/index.html).
